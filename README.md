This project demonstrates the integration of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) with Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) using the Ryu controller and Mininet. The objective is to showcase how centralized SDN controllers can enforce fine-grained security policies while providing scalability, flexibility, and enhanced monitoring.
